Everything runs on the elwire board right now. The original plan involved a seperate lillypad board, but it looks to be unecessary.
Just open up costume.pde and download it to your board and you should be good to go.
The arrays at the top of the file define which pins map to what, so you might need to change them depending on how you wired your costume up.
